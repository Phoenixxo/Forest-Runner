    <h1 align=Center> About Forest Runner</h1>

<div align=Center>
    <p> This game was made for experience and fun. Just a side project I made in school while in 10th grade. </p>
    <p> It is a simple side scroller game. Left and Right arrow keys to move & spacebar to jump. </p>
    <h2>Development Warning: </h2>
    <p> This game is still in an early stage and is not quite finished! </p>

## Details: 
This was fully written in [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

I used the [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library. It takes a little learning to get figure out but it becomes straight-forward. 


### **Disclaimer:**
Python is not reccommended for just making games. Python is better as a botting/scripting language afaik, as stated above this was just for a challenge and to learn python.
